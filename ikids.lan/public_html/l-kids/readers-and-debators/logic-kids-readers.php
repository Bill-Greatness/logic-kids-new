    History and secret inventions are passed on from generation to generation mostly through books. Better to read more to travel through peoples experiences than not to read at all. Our Readers Club encourages kids to be serial readers and information finders. This Club encourages research in participating kids.

    <h3 class="ui header">Program Structure</h3>

    <p class="ui text container">
        We encourage kids to read more. In order to enforce this? we have a program called "What did you read ?" which asks kids to spend a maximun of 20 minutes to read something. When done colleages of this kids finds out what he/she read. It is helpful as it gives kids some time to discover.
