        Programming in HTML and CSS is  a great way after Scratch programming to progress to the next level of programming. Currently is it a requirement to have your personal website. It is not difficult learning to create a website. Our HTML and CSS programs have got you kid(s) covered. We structure this program for kids to benefit from every lesson.

    <h3 class="ui header">Program Structure</h3>
    <div class="ui container">
    <p style='font-size:16px'>
    We begin by exposing kids to website with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) by getting their fingers dirty on using tags with the easiest way possible. We use real world examples to let them know what we'll be doing throughout our lessons.</p>

    After HTML lessons, we move on to CSS (Cascading StyleSheet) which adds value to our HTML codes. We train kids on the effective way to style their html codes by inserting background images or colors, working with padding and animations and others. When done with this lesson, kids create a simple webpage on their own to prepare for future lesson.

    During mid-session of our training we organize a syntax competition for kids to help them recall when and how to use some tags. This is an effective way for kids to remember and practice what they've done.</p>

    <h3 class="ui header">Is it too early for kids to design a website ?</h3>
    <div class="ui container">
    <p style='font-size:16px'>
    The earlier the better, research shows that kids who are exposed to programming or technology earlier tends to better that those who find it later in life.(conditions may differ). Kids learning to work on software and websites find out how to execute their ideas before something else becomes a hindrance. It is not too early. The time is now!
