        <h3 class="ui header">Why Space Science for Kids ?</h3>
        <p class="ui text container">
            At night, one kid may look up into the skies and wonder. They stand in awe and ask questions like "Where are the starts during the day ?" or "What is that gaint star light over there ?". 
            Admittedly, there are many thing in the outer space. One beyond the observable. From the cluster of galaxies to  the existence of black whole and other intellectual concepts that calls on our minds to find answers.

            How may Galaxies are out there?, How many moons are on other planets ? Our Program guides kids through such questions and we find answers together with them. Space Science is one great endeavor to curious kids. Where they tend to explore and know more about the universe.
        </p>

        <h3 class="ui header">Program Structure</h3>
        <p class="ui text container">Space is a vast and what people call an empty vacuum. It could take eternity to know what is in outerspace. Our Lessons take kids through series on space concepts starting from planets, to galaxies to black holes. We also take kids through the history of space travel, how planets are formed and encourage research amongst kids.

        <h3 class="ui header">The Curious Team</h3>
        <p class="ui text container">We work on curious teams around schools to be space gaints. These teams are those who run into competitions, who do their research independently and work on group projects and discuss and debate about topics.</p>
        <p class="ui text container">
            Kids who join this team are exceedingly smart and curious, age doesn't matter. Your research and type of question you ask give you a change to join the curious team. We provide the best under our space science lessons as we collaborate with foreign bodies for assistance. Logic Kids is a definition of kids future.
