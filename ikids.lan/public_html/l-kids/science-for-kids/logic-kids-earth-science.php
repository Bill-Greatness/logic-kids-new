        The science of Earth is the study of planet Earth. It covers all aspects of the planet, from the deep inner core to the outer atmosphere layers. There are many science fields that are part of earth science including geology (rocks and minerals), paleontology (dinosaurs and fossils), meteorology (atmosphere and weather), and oceanography to name just a few.

        <h3 class="ui header">Program Structure</h3>
        <p class="ui text container">
            Since earth science have different categories, we introduce the topics wholly upon discussion. Subsequent sessions are grouped to be studied under phases and to reach out to more kids for more information.
        </p>

        <h3 class="ui header">Earth Science Categories</h3>
        <p class="ui text container">
        The study of the Earth is often divided into different "spheres" of the Earth including the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.
        <br/>
        <br/>
Atmosphere - The atmosphere is the air around the Earth made up of different gasses (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). The atmosphere forms a protective layer around Earth, keeping the planet warm and protecting it from the Sun's radiation. The study of the atmosphere is called meteorology and includes the weather.
<br/>
<br/>
Biosphere - The biosphere is the region of Earth where life exists. It includes all the biomes and ecosystems around the planet.
<br/>
<br/>
Hydrosphere - The hydrosphere is the area of Earth covered by water including the oceans, glaciers, lakes, and rivers. Around 75% of the Earth's surface is covered by the ocean. The study of the ocean is called oceanography.
<br/>
<br/>
Lithosphere - The lithosphere is the outer layer of the Earth. It includes the Earth's crust and part of the mantle. The lithosphere is broken up into giant sections called tectonic plates. Geologists study the lithosphere including rocks, minerals, and the history of Earth.

        <h3 class="ui header">Research Team - Kids</h3>
        <p class="ui text  container">
            In every participating schools, kids are group into a team of research to dig to information and work on available data to answer basic questions. Each team presents their research data any is analysed by another group of the same category. During competitions, Each school bring on board the best of their researchers to present ideas to their audience. This simulates kids to know more and find out information on their own.
