        <p class="ui container">
        Learn about plants & animals as you spot them in an outdoor scene, discover more about where plants and animals live as well as other interesting facts. Different animals tend to live in different habitats that suit their characteristics, this is the same with plants, which thrive in an environment that suits them. See if you can spot living things such as flowers, trees, insects and birds as you complete the fun activities in this cool, interactive science game for kids.</p>

        <h3 class="ui header">Program Structure</h3>
        <p class="ui container">We provide interesting videos and visit experimental sites around to discover. We find what is hidden, we probe for answers and we use the answers to change the world. In a world in which we find plants and animals all around us, what can we possibly know about them and what can knowing about them help to know about our nature.</p>
