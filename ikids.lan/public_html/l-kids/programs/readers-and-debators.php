            <div class="description">
                Information is passed on from generations to generation through written or oral forms. To have the simulation of living multiple lives, a kid must learn to read great books. Not only does he/she grap sentences but a kids draw ideas from reading. In our part of the world, Reading is less encouraged here. With our team, we give kids reason to find information and process them create what teachs us, builds us and beyond that, give as the reason to inspire others.

    <p class="ui text">
    Our Debators Program is a hot one. Giving how kids do research and build their points on topics of interest is amazing. Where every research points to time and enough details are given to on a topic of opposition or a stance. This program encourages getting to know and understand our differences on topics and how subjective everything can be. This program is for kids who love the idea of thing out of the box.
