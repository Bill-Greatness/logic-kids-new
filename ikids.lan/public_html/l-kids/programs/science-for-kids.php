                <div class="description">
                Kids are naturally curios and want to experiment everything. Kids have numerous questions that whatever answer we give them, will lead to another question. Our Science Program is designed to make kids experiment and know that is happening in the scientific world where they apply logic and reason to find answers to questions. </div>
                <div class='description'>Taking them from basic biology to the fantastic realm of space. Kids love nature and our program guides them to greater heights</div>

    <h3 class="ui header">Program Structure</h3>
    <p class="ui text">
    This program is organized for kids from age 7 and above. Kids carry out basic experiments during lessons and are giving sample test to try at home. We also watch videos and have a fun time asking questions and discussing on topic. Kids are grouped to research on topics and are guided throughout their journey.
    </p>
    <p class='ui text'>
        We also carry out field experiments cautiously and work on excursion to visit natural sceneries. Kids are our priority and hence we desire to give the best of things we've ever wanted for them. Our science lessons inspire kids to know our nature and hence they aspire for higher positions.
