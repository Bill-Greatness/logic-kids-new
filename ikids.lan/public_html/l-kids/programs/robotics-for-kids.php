                <div class="description">
                   Robotics programs facilitates science and math learning inside the classroom. Kids also understand the concepts of tension and force when they choose the materials used in robots. Simple and complex mathematics concepts are also demonstrated while they assemble the robots.

    <h3 class="ui header">Program Structure</h3>
    <p class="ui container">
        We begin this lesson to taking kids through basic robotics concepts. some simple mathematics models governing robotics. With their robotics kits, we work on creating different things based on the ideals we've already worked on. After the first phase of the program, after kids have acquired the basic skills required to create things on their own, kids learn to work in groups hence establishing a cordial relation amongst each other and learning to understand team work. Since coding work on some sides of Robotics, we inject a programming language the encourages kids to do their best. 

        During competitions, ideas are presented in groups.Each participating member presents a side of the work and things goes as we plan...

    <h3 class="ui header">Some Robotics Sections</h3>
    <p class="ui container">
       The age of the kids and mental abilites to understand concepts determines which section he/she will be allowed to start with. For so long as we want to reach out to more kids as possible, we need to change the world and specifically Africa swiftly, developing the minds  of next generation geniuses to shape the world.
    </p>

    <p class="ui container">
       With any question regarding how this program is organized, either of schools or private lessons, you can kindly reach out to us to know how it is carried out. One can either purchase the required robotics kids form the internet or may purchase it from our center. We mean to encourage technology and science in kids.
